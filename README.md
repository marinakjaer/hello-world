# hello-world
ready to learn and practice

Just trying to figure out how all of this works - seems like a great concept!
I'm Marina and I'm new to coding, been learning the HTML, CSS basics and I'm currently on Javascript.
Hoping to attend a coding bootcamp soon, just need to decide on one :) 
Can't wait to create my own projects in the future as a confident full-stack developer.
